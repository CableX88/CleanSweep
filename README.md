# CleanSweep

Clean Sweep is an application designed to raise awareness of the littering problem across the world and help organize communal litter cleanups. When people come together for a noble cause, the result is feelings of unity, societal responsibility, an increase in self-esteem of the community as a whole. We only have one planet, and it's our responsibility to keep our beloved home clean.
